# Planned Features (calculator features)
- Milradian calculation based on type of mortar used
    - Calculation done with linear approximation of in-game milradian conversion values given
    - Implement mortar as a child of coordinate class
- Graphical interface (Qt) with in-game maps
    - Coordinates can be plotted and saved on a map

# Planned Features (non-calculator features)
- Track total personal ticket count accumulated through actions
- Track commander asset timing (planes and artillery)
- Track enemy armor assets
- Track enemy truck timers (logi, MSP)
- Overlay exclusion zone on map
    - Layer-specific objective locations and exclusion zones marked
- Overlay cap zones on map (warning: time-consuming)
- Place markers on map

# Misc. Things to do
- Verify if relative height between mortar and target affects calculations
